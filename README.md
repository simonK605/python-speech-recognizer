# Speech Recognition in Python

This Python script utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to perform speech recognition on an audio file. The script reads an audio file and uses the Google Web Speech API to recognize speech within the file.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the SpeechRecognition library installed. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
```

## Usage
Place your audio file in the 'audios' directory.
Update the harvard variable with the correct path to your audio file.

## Run the script:

```python
python your_script_name.py
```

Ensure that your audio file is in the correct format (WAV) and update the file path accordingly. The script will print whether speech is detected, not detected, or if there is an error with the API request.
